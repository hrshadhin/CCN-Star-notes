CCENT is the introduction to networking.
Its about Operation of data networks,swithed network,ip addessing and servicess, small routed network,WAN,Basic network security.


What is a Network?
   A collection of devices that can communicate together.

Network Topologis:

 	#Bus
	#Star
	#Ring

OSI Model:
=============
7 layers model

#Application
	Interraces with the application provides network access to apps
#Presentation
	Genetric-files the data. Encryption services
#Session
	starts and ends sessions
#Transport
	How the data is sent.
#Network
	Logical addressing, find path to a destination
#Data link
	Provides Physical addressing.ensure data is error-free.
#Physical
	Acess to the cable. Electrical signals.0 & 1


Basic TCP/IP:
=============
@ TCP/IP is a sute of Protocols.
 #Application layer
	Telnet,ftp,smtp,dns,RIP,snmp
 #Transport layer
	TCP,UDP
#internet layer
	IP->  IGMP,ICMP, ARP
#Network Access
	Ethernet,Token Ring,Frame relay,ATM

Two Address Concept:
-------------------
	#IP address(x.x.x.x)IPV4
	#Ethernet MAC address(XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX)

ARP(Address resulation protocol)
	Its always brodcast message

IP Address Classes:
===================
Class A:
--------
	-First octet of ip address is 1-126
	-Ex: 10.5.1.1
	-Has the subnet mask 255.0.0.0
The first octet of the ip is network and rests of hosts.
 
I.E:
   10.0.0.0 here 10 is a define the network and rest of all is hosts.This allows for 126 networks and 16,777,214 hosts per network. 

*CISCO recomended not use more than 500 Hosts in per network	

Class B:
---------
  -First octet of ip address is 128-191	
   -133.14.252.1
   -255.255.0.0
In this class first two octet of ip is networks and rest of hosts.This allows for 16,384 networks and 65,534 hosts per network.


Class C:
---------
  -First octet of ip address is 192-223
   -192.168.10.1
   -255.255.255.0
In this class first three octet of ip is networks and rest of hosts.This allows for 2,097,152 networks and 254 hosts per network.
---------------------------0-------------------------

Public Vs Private Addresses
==========================

#Public addresses:
	Usable on the internet and internal networks.

#private addresses:
	Usable only on internal networks.
